# Aerodrome Licensing Portal

This contains the portal for a **Knowledge Management System** that looks forward to completely digitise the licensing procedure of aerodromes. This project has been created for and presented to *Airport Authority of India* in the **Smart India Hackathon 2020 Grand Finale**.

The problem statement is as follows:

A web based application using Block chain technology is sought from Airport Licensing to retrieve important and relevant Project Related information from pool of data source i.e. SAP, E-mail, E-office, Scan documents and Database. Below features are desired in an application:
* Concerned Officers can upload relevant data related to Airport Licensing from Airports.
* Seamless Approval process, Centralized Monitoring and Suggestion Mechanism. 
* Relevant information should be fetched from data source, linked to a particular project which can be used in the hour of need.

Video Demonstration of our project can be seen here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLuQTiAaS8mhC3pmVI9g24RAh1nJ-VPf/view

This project has been created in **React** framework. It also uses **Fluent UI**, and has been wired up for requisite **Apollo GraphQL APIs** that we designed specifically for this portal.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
